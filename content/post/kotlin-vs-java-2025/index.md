Java has been a cornerstone of backend development for decades, powering everything from enterprise systems to cloud-native microservices. Kotlin, first released in 2011 and officially supported by Spring since 2017, offers a modern JVM alternative that has steadily gained traction among developers.

In 2025, both Java and Kotlin are mature, production-ready, and well-supported in the Spring ecosystem. But when starting a **new** project, it’s worth asking: which language provides more advantages today?

## Built-In Features vs. External Dependencies

In Java, some advanced capabilities require additional libraries, such as:

- **jSpecify** – for nullability annotations  
- **Vavr** – for functional programming utilities  
- **Lombok** – for reducing boilerplate code  
- **MapStruct** – for object mapping  

These libraries are useful, but they add extra setup, dependency management, and potential compatibility issues over time.

Kotlin includes many similar capabilities **natively**. The result is:

- Cleaner code with fewer dependencies  
- Reduced maintenance overhead  
- Consistent, “built-in” language-level support rather than relying on third-party solutions  

---

## Tooling and Developer Experience

Java has made great strides in reducing verbosity, particularly with features like **records**, **var**, and **pattern matching**. However, Kotlin takes this a step further with language constructs that are inherently more concise and expressive.

This difference is not just about avoiding getters and setters. Kotlin’s design encourages:

- Declarative, readable code  
- Fewer repetitive patterns  
- A smoother learning curve for developers coming from modern languages

## Java’s Rapid Evolution — and Kotlin’s Advantage

Java now follows a twice-yearly release cycle, which has brought meaningful improvements to the language. But some of Kotlin’s core features may take years to appear in Java — if they appear at all.

Because Kotlin runs on the JVM and is fully interoperable with Java, it benefits from JVM improvements **and** continues to add its own language features independently.

## Key Kotlin Features for Modern Spring Development

Here are some Kotlin features that many teams find hard to give up once adopted:

1. **Null-Safety and Nullability** – Built into the type system to prevent `NullPointerException`.  
2. **Extension Functions** – Add methods to existing classes without modifying them.  
3. **Higher-Order Functions** – Functional programming as a first-class citizen.  
4. **Inline Functions & Lambdas with Receivers** – Enable clean DSLs and reduce overhead.  
5. **Data Classes** – Concise, immutable by default, and with auto-generated methods.  
6. **Default & Named Parameters** – Avoids excessive constructor overloading.  
7. **Smart Casts** – Automatic safe casting without extra syntax.  
8. **Destructuring Declarations** – Unpack objects into variables easily.  
9. **Top-Level Functions** – Functions outside classes for cleaner APIs.  
10. **Type Inference Everywhere** – Less boilerplate, more clarity.  
11. **Rich Standard Library for Collections** – Expressive and powerful operations.  
12. **Immutability by Default** – Encourages safer and more predictable code.

## Conclusion

When starting a new Spring project in 2025, both Java and Kotlin are solid choices.

- **Java** offers unmatched stability, a massive ecosystem, and rapid ongoing improvements.  
- **Kotlin** provides modern language features, reduced boilerplate, and a developer experience that’s both concise and expressive from day one.

For teams looking to balance **productivity**, **readability**, and **long-term maintainability**, Kotlin presents a compelling option — especially when building new services on top of the Spring framework.
